# Pig-Game
This project is a dice game in which players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.
It is a 2 player game in which the one who reach a score of 100 will win the game.
We can play the game by using New game functionality present in the project.
